**A flexible, charge-based inventory protection plugin for modern Minecraft servers.**

</div>

---

## 🌟 Overview

**InsureInv** gives players peace of mind by protecting their items and experience upon death using a robust **charge system**. Instead of enabling a global `keepInventory` rule that trivializes survival gameplay, InsureInv brings balance by requiring players to purchase "charges" using in-game currency. Each death automatically consumes one charge to keep their inventory intact.

Designed with performance in mind, it fully supports **Paper 1.20.1+** and **Folia**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Charge-based Saves:** Move away from binary `keepInventory` rules. Define custom prices and maximum limits for inventory protection charges.
- **⚡ Next-Gen Compatibility:** Built natively for modern server environments, with full **Folia** support.
- **💰 Seamless Economy Integration:** Hook into **Vault**, **VaultUnlocked**, or **PlayerPoints** to let players seamlessly buy charges. Economy features can also be completely disabled for custom use cases.
- **💾 Flexible Database Options:** Use what works for your network—scales from simple **SQLite** and **JSON** to dedicated **MySQL** connection pools (via HikariCP).
- **🌍 Multi-language / i18n:** Built-in per-player language support lets your international community read messages in their native tongue.

## ⚙️ Configuration Configuration

The `config.yml` file is straightforward to set up out of the box.

### `storage` Options
- **`sqlite` (Default)**: Saves data in a local `data.db` file. Clean and simple.
- **`mysql`**: Highly recommended for multi-server networks. Uses HikariCP for asynchronous connection pooling.
- **`json`**: Saves data locally in a `data.json` file. Only use for testing or very low-traffic servers.

### `economy` Options
Controls how players acquire charges:
- `VAULT` (Default): Hooks into your Vault-compatible economy plugin (EssentialsX, etc). **Not available on Folia.**
- `VAULT_UNLOCKED`: Hooks into [VaultUnlocked](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vaultunlocked.117277/), a modern fork of Vault with **Folia support**.
- `PLAYER_POINTS`: Deducts from [PlayerPoints](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerpoints.80745/). Works on all platforms.
- `NONE`: No economy features. Commands like `/insureinv buy` are disabled. Useful if admins want to hand out charges directly via scripts or crates.

#### Automatic Provider Priority

If the configured provider is unavailable (or incompatible with the server platform), InsureInv automatically falls back through a priority list:

| Platform       | Priority Order                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Paper / Spigot | `VAULT` → `VAULT_UNLOCKED` → `PLAYER_POINTS` → `NONE` |
| Folia          | `VAULT_UNLOCKED` → `PLAYER_POINTS` → `NONE`            |

You can override the default by setting `economy.provider` in `config.yml`. If the chosen provider isn't available, the plugin falls back to the next in the platform priority list.

Configure `price-per-charge` and `max-charges-per-player` in `config.yml` according to your server's economy balance.

## 📊 bStats Metrics

To help me understand how the plugin is being used and to plan future updates, InsureInv uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/InsureInv/29775) to collect anonymous, basic server data (like the Java version, server software, and player counts). It does not collect any identifying information about your server or your players.

### How to Disable bStats
If you wish to opt out of data collection, you can safely disable metrics in the `config.yml`:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

You can also opt-out globally for your whole server by modifying the bStats config located at `plugins/bStats/config.yml`.
